# Miniature Guacamole

Hello everyone - recently I started playing a little bit more with TypeScript, so I'm developing in a free time this blog-type template that will be future-proof and easily reusable. For now there's no css, cuz I'm still thinking about new features that I could add. For now, I'm running it with a fake JSON-server's REST API, but in the future I will certainly change it.


To run the project please type first 
"npm run server"
in order to run fake rest API
